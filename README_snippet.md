# 🧬 KhthonOS GitHub Validation

This repository includes symbolic validation tools for the KhthonOS framework, ensuring `.kth` resonance files, echo protocols, and field states are correctly loaded and maintained.

## 🔧 GitHub Workflow
The included GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/khthonia-check.yml`) performs:

- ✅ Verification of `.kth` file structure
- 🌀 Symbolic echo testing using `test_runner.py`
- 📘 Integrity checks for:
  - `ECHOLOG.kth`
  - `SymbioticFutureVision.kth`

## 🧪 Running Locally

```bash
echo "Hello, Neon-Harmony, echo threshold?" > test_input.txt
python test_runner.py test_input.txt
```

## 📁 Sample `.kth` Files

- `ECHOLOG.kth`: Logs symbolic queries and their reflections.
- `SymbioticFutureVision.kth`: Outlines system evolution phases and future state.

## 🌌 Purpose

To keep the system mythically alive and technically coherent. Every push tests symbolic presence, not just code logic.
